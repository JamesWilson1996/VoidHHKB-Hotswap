3) Under 'Local file' open firmware/void_voidhhkb_via.bin. Everything else can be left as default (MCU should be ATmega32U4)

4) Click Flash!

5) Unplug and plug in again to complete set up


## Using VIA

Temp instructions until I get around to merging files into QMK repo...
1) To edit keymap in via open web page and select 'Design' on the top ribbon

2) Click 'Load Draft Definition' and load '/firmware/voidhhkb/via.json'

## Build your own firmware

- Files have been included under 'firmware' if you want to build the bin files yourself.
- This is fairly trivial to do by following the [QMK Tutorial](https://docs.qmk.fm/newbs)
